Each rust file has a series of numbers and dashes.
Each number is page/chapter covered in 'Easy Rust'.

'Easy Rust' is a tutorial for Rust directed towards 
non-native English speakers; it's specifically written
in a dialect known as simple English.

It's a lot easier to understand than the rust book and rust by example.

These are my personal notes from going thru it.
