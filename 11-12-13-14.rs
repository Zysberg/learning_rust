/*
	Variables cannot be change in value once defined

	If you'd like to make a variable manipulatable, use the 'mut' keyword
		- this will change the value, but you cannot change the type of the variable

	Shadowing
		- using 'let' to declare a new variable with the same name as other variables.
		- useful when you need to change a variable a lot, doing constant let statements
			that shadow bears the same name is faster than making the var mutable
		- It happens where you want to quickly take variable, do something to it, 
			and do something else again. 
		- You usually use it for quick variables that you don't care too much about.
		- Space complex but time simple

/*
	stack
		- faster than heap
		- stores variables
		- cannot use all the time because:
			- Rust needs to know size of variables at compile time (i32's u8's etc.)
			- some types you do not know at compile time
	
	heap 
		- slower, but can use as much space as you need for non-standard types
		- literally allocated chunks of memory

	pointers (in rust, they are called references).
		- reference points to the memory address of another value
		- reference means you borrow the value, but you don't own it
			(ie, ToC doesn't own the info, the chapters of the book own the info)
